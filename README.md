# Game_with_NEAT
This program uses a genetic algorithm called NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train an agent to play a game.

The training.py file showcases the training and evolution process.
The trained.py file showcases the trained agent playing the game. 
neat_config_training.text are the NEAT algorithms specifications/parameters for training.
neat_config_trained.txt are the NEAT algorithms specifications/parameters for the trained agent.
