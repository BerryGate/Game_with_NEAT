# Game_with_NEAT
This program uses a genetic algorithm called NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train an agent to play a game.

The goald of the game is to eat the food blocks which randomly appear while avoiding to hit the wall. 

The training.py file showcases the training and evolution process.
The trained.py file showcases the trained agent playing the game. 
The neat_config_training.text file is the NEAT algorithms specifications/parameters for training.
The neat_config_trained.txt is the NEAT algorithms specifications/parameters for the trained agent.
